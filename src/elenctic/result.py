"""Outcome data types: ``Observable``, ``Verdict``, and the ``Determination`` (spec §3, §5).

A solved program yields a :data:`Determination` — aspis's three-arm outcome surface
(``~/Projects/aspis/docs/spec.md §5``): :class:`Inconsistent` (AS(P)=∅), :class:`Inconclusive`
(the solve was cut off), or one of the :class:`Consistent` family. Each ``Consistent`` shape carries
*exactly* the observations its run-mode computes, so a field's absence is a type fact, not a
sentinel — there is no ``NotConfigured`` and no per-field guard.

A check reads a field through one accessor (``*_of``); the single centralised ``_seam_violation`` is
the one narrowing assertion, unreachable through the supported path on **two** premises: (1) the
``reads ⊆ populates`` wiring rule (``run.py``) attaches a check only to a run whose mode populates
what it reads, and (2) the lowering postcondition — ``solvers.py`` produces, for a run of mode M,
exactly the ``Consistent`` shape whose fields are ``populates(M)``. Checks (``checks.py``) are pure
functions of a ``Determination``; only ``solvers.py`` constructs one.
